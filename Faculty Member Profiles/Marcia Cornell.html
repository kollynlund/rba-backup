Marcia Cornell has been an entrepreneur and small business owner for over 16 years. She launched My Mind’s Eye in 1999 with a hand-illustrated line of kit-focused scrapbooking products. The designs were immediately popular and set off a series of successes and rapid growth for the company. In 2013, Marcia welcomed Hazel and Ruby into the My Mind's Eye Family and in 2014 she started My Colors which specializes in a high quality, core-dyed line of card-stock, perfect for professional designers and serious hobbyists alike. Seeing a need in the market, Marcia recently launched My Mind’s Eye Paper Goods which produces upscale stationary and decorative party goods. Alongside the continued popularity of their printed products, the My Mind's Eye award-winning designs have jumped off the printed page to be seen in home decor and fabrics. Marcia is grateful for the team of artists and professionals she has built allowing her the flexibility to run her company while raising her 3 children.
